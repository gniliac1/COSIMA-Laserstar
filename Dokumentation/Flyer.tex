\section{Secret Lab of Experimental Stuff}

The Secret Lab of Experimental Stuff is a top-secret laboratory
whose existence is highly classified so don't tell anyone about it
or we'll get really cross with you.

The University of Somewhere denies all knowledge of the Secret Lab
of Experimental Stuff, except on Open Days where members of the
public may visit the facility and ask questions as long as they
consent to a memory wipe when they leave. The memory wipe is
harmless (well, we haven't really tested it properly, but no one's
complained so far) and your memory of the visit will be replaced by
a pleasant recollection of spending the day feeding the ducks in the
nearby pond.
