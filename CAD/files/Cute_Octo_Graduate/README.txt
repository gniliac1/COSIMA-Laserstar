# Summary

Cute Octo designed by MakerBot is ready for this years graduation. '15 on the cap and a loop on the back for use as a key chain gift. My sister really wanted one for her graduation so I modeled it in Rhino 3D. No support material required.   

EDIT: I moved the number 15 to the back of the cap so that if you want you can change colors before the last layer prints. As you can see with the ones I printed it helps the number stand out. 

EDIT: I added a 2016, since its that year now.

# Instructions

NO SUPPORT. I used a printrbot simple black and used semiflex so that he is squishy. I used 200 micron layer height and 5% infill. You could easily switch out colors mid-print to do the cap in a different color!
